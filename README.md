# ze-Deadcore-w5-Stripper
This stripper will add extra stages.

In this map, there are a lot of color corrections. I already found there are red, blue, green, orange, yellow, purple, and black_white (it will be monochrome). You can make a lot of xxxCore and play them. Thanks Airvulpes and I love ze_deadcore forever.

Of course you know, s7f2 version has a lot of extra stages(Champion, Knightmare, Knightmare-Crying, Erro##, Knightmare v2) but v1_3 version has only Redcore and Champcore. Sad.
